Description
---

* statePanel.R creates blank state system membership (panel) data over some specific time period with yearly or monthly observations for countries in existence at a particular time based on the Gleditsch and Ward or Correlates of War state system membership lists.

* worldMap.R produces thematic maps for binary, categorical, and continous outcomes. Chances are that you will have to modify the code for whatever you are mapping, but this should at least be a start.
