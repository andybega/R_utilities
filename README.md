Miscallenous R stuff
===

Various R functions/stuff that I might reuse between projects. 

The easiest way to source these if you want to use them is via `devtools::source_url`:

```
library("devtools")
source_url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andybega/r-misc/master/load_libs.R")
```

## Pointers

For creating country-year or similar data of independent states over some time period, see https://github.com/andybega/states.

Notes on running stuff on EC2 or Digital Ocean servers [server/](server/)
